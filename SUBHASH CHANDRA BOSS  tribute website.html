    <p><b>Subhas Chandra Bose[f] (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British
            authority in India made him a hero among many Indians,[g][h][i] but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany
            and
            Fascist Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism,[16][j][k][l] anti-Semitism,[19][m][n][o][p][q][24]
            and
            military failure.[r][27][28][s][t] The honorific 'Netaji' (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first applied
            to
            Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian
            officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.[u][31]

            Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. He
            received
            an education oriented towards British standards and was subsequently sent to England to take the Indian
            Civil
            Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the first exam but chose not to proceed with the
            standard
            final exam. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the
            Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which
            was
            less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism.[v] Bose became Congress president in 1938.
            After
            reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the
            future
            federation of British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress
            leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for
            himself.[33]
            After the large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned in protest,[34] Bose resigned as
            president and was eventually ousted from the party.[35][36]
