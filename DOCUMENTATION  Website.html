                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language primarily known for bringing
                    interactivity to
                    web pages.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML (which defines
                        the structure of web content) and CSS (which controls the styling and layout).
                        Originally, JavaScript's main role was in client-side development, running directly within a
                        user's
                        web
                        browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This enables dynamic content, interactive elements like clickable buttons, form validation,
                        animations,
                        and real-time updates without requiring a full page reload.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <br>
                    <p>Java:
                        Type: A high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language.
                        Execution: Compiled into bytecode, which then runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This
                        allows for
                        platform
                        independence ("write once, run anywhere").
                        Use Cases: Primarily used for building robust, large-scale applications, enterprise-level
                        software,
                        Android
                        mobile applications, and server-side development.
                        Typing: Statically typed, meaning variable types are explicitly declared at compile time.
                        Concurrency: Supports multi-threading, allowing for parallel execution of tasks.<br>
                        JavaScript:
                        Type: A high-level, prototype-based, object-oriented scripting language.
                        Execution: Interpreted directly by web browsers for client-side scripting, or by runtime
                        environments
                        like
                        Node.js for server-side development.
                        Use Cases: Primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages, enhancing user
                        interfaces
                        (UI/UX),
                        and
                        building single-page applications.
                        Typing: Dynamically typed, meaning variable types can change during runtime and do not need
                        explicit
                        declaration.
                        Concurrency: Primarily single-threaded, often employing asynchronous programming patterns to
                        handle
                        non-blocking
                        operation</p><br>

                            <p> In JavaScript, variables are named containers used to store data values. These value can
                                be of various datatypes, such as numbers,
                                strings, booleans, objects, and more. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data
                                throughout your program.
                                Variables in JavaScript are declared using one of three keywords: var, let</p>

                                <p>Server-Side JavaScript
                                    In the early days, JavaScript was used for front-end development to add behaviors to
                                    HTML pages. Since 2009, JavaScript is also used as a server-side programming
                                    language to
                                    build scalable and dynamic web applications.

                                    Node.js is one of the best and most popular JavaScript runtime environments for
                                    building
                                    the server of applications using JavaScript. Using Node.js, we can execute the
                                    JavaScript code outside the browser and manage the server task. The server tasks can
                                    be
                                    an interaction with the database, APIS, file handling, or maybe network
                                    communication.
                                    Due to the event-driven architecture of Node.js, it is faster than other server-side
                                    programming languages.</p>
